# SimplexPy
Simplex algorithm is a widely-used mathematical technique for solving linear programming problems.

The code provided is a version of the Simplex algorithm rewritten in Python, based on an initial implementation in C. It includes a class named OptList, which provides a representation of a list, and also overrides the default behavior of the +, -, and * operators for instances of the class.

## how to execute this code?
### There are two ways to execute this code:
* by utilizing the file selection dialog to pick the desired file:
* 
The initial directory for the file selection dialog is the "c:" drive, you can change it.

The file "network1.txt" has a unique structure compared to the other files. In the original C implementation, it could be read as is, but in Python, our code has a different method of handling it, thus the file had to be altered for compatibility. The modified version of the file is included.
